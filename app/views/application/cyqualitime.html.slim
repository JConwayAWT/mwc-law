            p <span class="paragraph-start">Cyqualitime&#8480;</span> (<span class="paragraph-italic">noun,</span>  sī-kwälə-tīm), a philosophy and practice unique to the law firm of McCabe, Weisberg &amp; Conway (MWC), is a term derived from the combination of “cycle time” and “quality”. Cycle time is the total time from the beginning to the end of a process, as defined by you and your customer . Quality is the standard of something as measured against other things of a similar kind: the degree of excellence of something<sup>1</sup>.
            p Cyqualitime&#8480; is the perfect balance of two opposite and yet complimentary objectives – minimal cycle time and maximum quality – resulting in peak performance and unrivaled service. The term is elegantly simple shorthand to describe the profoundly complex reality of achieving the optimal state of performance for MWC clients.
            p The immutable law of unintended consequences means best intentions can inadvertently cause adverse effects.  Go too fast to shorten cycle times, and quality can suffer.  Go too slow to achieve near perfection, and cycle times can slow to a crawl.  Construct rigid processes to enhance productivity, and quality and the volume of daily exceptions overwhelm the system.  These are just a few of the numerous factors that need to be considered and thoughtfully balanced to achieve Cyqualitime&#8480;.
            p Cyqualitime&#8480; is a philosophy and journey, constantly evolving and transforming in response to and in anticipation of the needs of MWC clients.  This philosophy has been shaped and honed by almost 40 years of experience, knowledge, and expertise, which is unmatched in the mortgage banking industry.
